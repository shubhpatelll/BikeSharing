# DM Bike Share 

## Overview
Kate wants to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines,very similar to  New-York City's bike share program. She wants to analyze New-York City's Citi Bike data that has been released to the public. The purpose of this analysis is to present the viability of bike sharing program for De Moines using NYC's Citi bike program. Tableau is used to present the analysis in nice  and simple visual form to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

#### Analysis of the Story
* 1. <u>Trips analysis by Tripduration</u>. Most of the rides are of 5 minutes and majority of them are less then 20 mins. There are a very few rides beyond 1 hour.

* 2. <u>Trips analysis by tripduration and gender</u>. 5 mins ride are the most preffered among men and 6 mins among female. While there are 3 times more male riders then female. ![](https://github.com/dhaval-28/bikesharing2/blob/main/Images/2-Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)
* 3. <u>Trips by each day of the week</u>. Morning 7am to 8am and evening 5pm -7 pm are the busiest time.![](https://github.com/dhaval-28/bikesharing2/blob/main/Images/3-Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
* 4. <u>Trips by gender by each day of week/end</u>. During pick hours, there are more male riders then female. Morning 7am to 8am and evening 5pm -7 pm are the most preferred timings for rides among all gender types.![](https://github.com/dhaval-28/bikesharing2/blob/main/Images/4-Trips%20by%20Gender%20-%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)
* 5. <u>Trips by type of users & type of gender during weekdays </u>. There are most riders on Thursday and Friday. Most of them are Male with subscribed service. ![](https://github.com/dhaval-28/bikesharing2/blob/main/Images/5-User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)


#### Analysis of additional visualizations
* 1. <u>Type of Customers</u>.  Majority of the customers like to subscribe the service.<br>

* 2. <u>Most popular starting points</u>. There are specific points which are more favored to start the bike ride.![](https://github.com/dhaval-28/bikesharing2/blob/main/Images/7-Top%20Starting%20Location.png)


## Summary
* 1. Bike rides for shorter durations are more preferred by riders. So, the charges could be higher for shorter trips. 
* 2. Most male and female like to have shorter rides for 5 and 6 minutes respectively. But number of female riders are still 1/3rd of male. There should be some sort of special promotions to attract more female riders.
* 3. Morning 7am to 8am and evening 5pm -7 pm are the busiest time. Late evening (after 10pm to 5am) are the least pick timings. They could be used for maintenance purpose without impacting sales.
* 4. Morning 7am to 8am and evening 5pm -7 pm are the most preferred hours for all gender types.  This will be the period to judge what's the maximum number of bikes needed to run the bike sharing program without having a scarcity of bikes at any given time of the day and week.
* 5. Thursday and Fridays are the most pick timings for bike sharing program. All bikes should be available on these days and there should be no planned maintenance.

### Summary of two additional visualizations
* 1. It seems subscription model is more preferred amount riders and there are more regular bikers then customers who uses bike share program once in a while. This could be true more for NYC as there are more tourist any given day.
* 2. There are certain points which are more preferred to start the bike-ride. Des Moins would have the similar situation and those points would need to have more bikes compare to others. 

### Additional visualizations recommendation 
* 1. Bike share points on a map by gender :  This will help to understand if certain points are more or least popular among certain gender type. 
* 2. Bike share points on a map by age group : This will help to understand if certain points are more or least popular among certain age group.
